[This Blog](http://ranmocy.info) is [first created](https://github.com/ranmocy/ranmocy_blog) at Jan 26, 2012,
written in Ruby on Rails with a dark design, hosted at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

Later, I rewrote the UI in a very light style to guide readers to focus on the content.

Then static bloggers rose, and since Heroku was very slow in China,
I abandoned Rails and migrated it to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/),
hosted at [Github](https://github.com/) and [GitCafe](https://gitcafe.com/) which is my first involved startup company.

And finally, I rewrote the UI again and it became what you can see today.

Along with this exploration, I setup a project for myself, "[Brain](https://github.com/ranmocy/brain)", to record my mind and what did I do.
As a side effect, it introduced project [Smallest Blogger](http://ranmocy.github.io/smallest-blogger/) which aims to experiment how little code is needed to write a static blog generator.
I made it with less than 200 lines of Ruby.

(Broad-)logging is life time project, as I am trying with Brain.
